# Bugs

-   Centering issues with page contents on pages. create one layout that all pages are using.

*   When using chrome incognito a user will be logged into a different account. This needs to be discussed with the product manager and Okta. We believe this is an Okta issue.

*   Login page shouldn't be available when logged in.

*   Scanner should clear state instead of the redirect page.

*   If emoji on redirect page is off centered with animation - we think it has to do with font and styling- we suggest using an Emoji Image on the Redirect Page instead of the Emoji code.
