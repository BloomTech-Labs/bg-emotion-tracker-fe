# Suggestions

*   Consolidate Style frameworks. Currently we use Less and Styled-components which isn't ideal. We suggest to just pick on or the other (styled-components or Less).

*   All pages should be responsive and look good on mobile.

*   Review icons for menu. Some icons don't seem to match their links.

*   There is currently no unit testing and it would be a better practice if we include testing and have at least 80% coverage.

*   Since we are using libzy for documentation, Storybook should be removed.

*   /api/index should be refactored. We have hardcoded urls to meet mvp, but it does need to be deduped.

*   ReportsWidget should be more organized.

*   Relook at state management.
