# APIs

## Okta Authentication

The sign-in experience is one of the most important user experiences any app developer needs to consider. To provide a seamless and attractive, yet secure authentication experience is not a trivial task. Typically, the sign-in logic accompanies other features such as password reset and registration. More importantly, enhanced security in the form of strong and adaptive authentication during the sign-in process is often critical to many implementations.

Okta provides many options for developers to handle the authentication experience that are built on top of the underlying feature set in Okta. Password policies, strong and adaptive authentication policies, and password reset workflow can all be configured easily in the administrator UI. Many of these policies can also be controlled through Okta's API.

Okta provides OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect implementations, the Sign-In Widget, the Auth JS SDK, and the Authentication API.
